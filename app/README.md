# create-ruistack-app

Putting together a full-stack React, Express, TypeScript web app demonstrating some of what I believe to be best practives.

Inspired by [create-nhollas-app](https://github.com/Nhollas/create-nhollas-app), many thanks Nick üôè‚ù§Ô∏è

### Still left to do:

 - [ ] Switch styling to tailwind (or css modules?)
 - [ ] integrate component library, maybe shadcn/ui
 - [ ] Add react-query, maybe to use API
 - [ ] Global types (or zod schemas) so you can reuse
 - [ ] Add playwright component and end-to-end tests
 - [ ] Actually make this a generator instead of just a repo with a sample app

### Maybe:

 - Hook up with tRPC
