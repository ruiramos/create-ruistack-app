# create-ruistack-app

Putting together a full-stack React, Express, TypeScript web app.

### TODO 

 - [ ] Switch styling to tailwind (or css modules?)
 - [ ] integrate component library, maybe shadcn/ui
 - [ ] Add react-query, maybe to use API
 - [ ] Global types (or zod schemas) so you can reuse
 - [ ] Add playwright component and end-to-end tests
