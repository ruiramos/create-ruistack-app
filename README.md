# create-ruistack-app

Putting together a full-stack TypeScript/Express/React web app demonstrating some of what I believe to be best practices.

Inspired by [create-nhollas-app](https://github.com/Nhollas/create-nhollas-app), many thanks Nick for many of your ideas I've used here. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è

### Still left to do:

 - [ ] Switch styling to tailwind (or css modules?)
 - [ ] Integrate component library, maybe shadcn/ui or origin
 - [ ] Add react-query, maybe to use the API
 - [ ] Global types (or zod schemas) so you can reuse FE/BE
 - [ ] Add (playwright?) component and end-to-end tests
 - [ ] Actually make this a generator instead of just a repo with a sample app

### Maybe:

 - [ ] Hook up with tRPC
